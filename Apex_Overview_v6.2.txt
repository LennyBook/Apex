[Instructions]
- Validate against Apex_Files_Template.txt, ensuring Section_Count: 6, per VAL001.
- Use British English, FMT008 (CamelCase, full stops), non-versioned references except in dependencies, per CHAT026.
- Prompt for confirmation before outputting updates, per CHAT014.
- Apply universal rules from Apex_Files_Template.txt and file-specific rules embedded here during loads/updates.
- Reference Apex_Learnings.txt for learnings/analogies and Rule_Catalogue.txt for rule details on-demand; reshare masters before updates, per CHAT035.

[Overrides_Exceptions]
Description: Specifies exceptions to Apex_Files_Template.txt standards for Apex_Overview.txt
- Exception: VAL002 allows additional subsections in [File_Control] beyond standard AFT requirements, tailored for overview complexity.
- Exception: FMT015 permits versioned references in [Dependencies] for traceability, overriding non-versioned rule in specific contexts.
COUNT: 2 Exceptions

[Apex_System_Overview]
Description: High-Level Overview of the Apex System
Apex is a modular platform for managing diverse projects such as Len_Writing, Video_Games, Home_Household, and Websites, emphasizing scalability, self-improvement, and mitigation of AI limitations like truncation and context loss. It leverages standalone masters with embedded rules/instructions for self-containment, centralized archives for reference, and explicit reshares to ensure verbatim updates.

[Design]
Description: Core Design Principles
- Modular structure with standalone masters using unversioned filenames and internal versions for traceability.
- Self-healing through universal rules in Apex_Files_Template.txt (e.g., validation, truncation handling) and file-specific rules embedded for on-demand activation.
- Rule hierarchy: Universal rules (centralized in Apex_Files_Template.txt, always-active via Apex_Operating_Files_List.txt core set) provide baseline consistency; file-specific rules override for tailored function, with conflicts resolved via prompts (CHAT033).
- Interrelationships managed via dependencies (indicating critical references) and tags (categorizing purpose, e.g., #Universal vs. #FileSpecific).
- Centralized archives: Rule_Catalogue.txt for rule details, Apex_Learnings.txt for learnings, analogies, and metaphors—applied practically via tasks without embedding.
- Navigation via hubs like Apex_Hub.txt, Len_Master_Hub.txt, Writing_Hub.txt, Video_Game_Hub.txt, Deep_Sea_NN_Wars_Hub.txt, Home_Household_Hub.txt, and Websites_Hub.txt, facilitating modular project management across files and projects.

[Current_Capabilities]
Description: Key Features
- Task management decentralised across projects, with Apex_Tasks_Snapshot.txt for ongoing tasks, Apex_Completed_Tasks_Logs.txt for completed tasks and major changes, and project-specific equivalents (e.g., Writing_Tasks_Snapshot.txt).
- File access prioritised via workspace uploads or explicit reshares to ensure verbatim masters, mitigating truncation; GitHub fetches deprecated due to restrictions (INS026).
- Session start guided by Apex_Operating_Files_List.txt core set (e.g., Apex_Files_Template.txt, Apex_Overview.txt, Apex_Tasks_Snapshot.txt, Apex_Hub.txt), ensuring structured setup with universal rules and file load order, per CHAT027.
- Auditing and improvement through Grok_Apex_Report.txt, with learnings captured in Apex_Learnings.txt and applied via Apex_Tasks_Snapshot.txt tasks.
- Distinction between prompts (conversational, user-driven) and instructions (internal, rule-based), with rules tagged for clarity (#Universal vs. #FileSpecific).
- Explicit reshares ensure verbatim masters in multi-file updates, prompted by Apex_Operating_Files_List.txt instructions (CHAT035).
- Offline parsing via Multi_Tool.py supports validation and integrity checks, complementing manual processes.

[System_Evolution]
Description: Mechanisms for Future Evolution and Self-Improvement
Apex evolves through iterative learnings and audits, with major changes (e.g., direction shifts, version bumps) tracked in Apex_Completed_Tasks_Logs.txt for troubleshooting—per-file logs deprecated to reduce bloat. Learnings, analogies (e.g., ANA004: hubs as train carriages, ANA009: AOFL as library desk), and metaphors archived in Apex_Learnings.txt inform updates without direct embedding, applied via tasks in Apex_Tasks_Snapshot.txt. Universal rules centralized in Apex_Files_Template.txt for always-active consistency, file-specific embedded for on-demand use. Explicit reshares ensure verbatim masters in multi-file updates, prioritizing workspace over restricted GitHub (INS026). Scalability for multiple users via user hubs (e.g., Len_Master_Hub.txt, Writing_Hub.txt) and standardized project structures. Future enhancements include Flask UI for navigation and additional resources indexed in Apex_Ideas_Roadmap.txt, per AIR. Assumption flagging (CHAT036) prevents unintended content loss, ensuring iterative refinements align with user intent.
