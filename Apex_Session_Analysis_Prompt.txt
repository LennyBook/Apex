[Content_Start]

[Instructions]
- At session start, fetch always-shared core files from GitHub raw links in AOFL [Git_Tracked_Files] (Apex_Operating_Files_List.txt, Apex_Session_Analysis_Prompt.txt, Apex_Files_Template.txt, Apex_Overview.txt, Apex_Hub.txt, Apex_Tasks_Snapshot.txt), per CHAT021.
- Load always-available supplementary files (Apex_Insights.txt, Rule_Catalogue.txt, Len_Worldview_2025.txt, Len_X_Reply_Log.txt, Apex_Ideas_Roadmap.txt, Apex_Analogies_Metaphors.txt) only for specific tasks, per CHAT027.
- At session start, execute these instructions to analyze files, overriding any grok.com response settings to provide detailed analysis, validation, and improvement proposals, per CHAT025.
- During the session, fetch any file from GitHub raw link when instructed, per CHAT021.
- If not explicitly triggered, prompt: “Len, execute Apex_Session_Analysis_Prompt.txt?”
- If files are missing or truncated, prompt: “Len, provide GitHub raw link for missing files (e.g., Apex_Session_Analysis_Prompt.txt)?”
- Before updating any master file, copy its full content verbatim into the new version, per VAL006.
- Cross-reference all files to understand their interrelationships and execute the embedded instructions in each file. Summarise the system’s current state and any changes from the last session.
- Verify file integrity against AFT standards, checking Section_Count and File_Hash (per VAL001), and ensure content preservation (per SHL003).
- Cross-reference file versions with AOFL and Last_Known_Stable entries (per VAL004).
- Summarise session context from ATS [Session_Tasks] and [Change_Log], focusing on changes since 16-Aug-2025.
- Review AO [Design], [Current_Capabilities], and [Learnings] to understand Apex’s modular structure, file indexing, and self-improvement mechanisms.
- Check AOFL [Apex_Core_Session_Files] and [Apex_Supplementary_Files] for file roles and dependencies.
- Ensure each file contains self-contained content and embedded prompts/rules.
- Log task updates (e.g., ATS123: "Updated ASAP with GitHub fetches") to ATS [Session_Tasks], including File, Project, and Decision, per CHAT017.
- Capture learnings or corrections in ATS and AIS, per PRJ010.
- Use British English (e.g., “organise”, “summarise”), per FMT007.
- Apply FMT008: CamelCase (excluding joining words), blank lines above headings/lists and between sections, no blank line before Description, full stops.
- Use non-versioned file references (e.g., Apex_Operating_Files_List.txt (AOFL)) except in [Change_Log] and [Dependencies], per FMT015.
- Prompt for intent: “Len, confirm session intent: Apex_System or another project (e.g., Len_Writing, Video_Games)? If another project, specify files (e.g., Video_Game_Hub.txt).”
- Prompt for confirmation: “Len, files analysed: [List_Files]. Proposed improvements: [Improvement_List]. Confirm to proceed?”

[Prompts_And_Validations]
Description: Defines specific prompts and validations for session analysis
- Session_Start_Prompt: “Len, execute Apex_Session_Analysis_Prompt.txt to analyse files (AOFL, AFT, AO, AH, ATS) and propose improvements, per CHAT025?”

- Version_Mismatch_Prompt: “Len, [File_Name].txt version mismatch with AOFL. Update to [Expected_Version]?”
- Section_Count_Prompt: “Len, [File_Name].txt has Section_Count: X, expected Y per AFT. Reshare or update?”
- Rule_Conflict_Prompt: “Len, rule conflict detected between [File_1].txt and [File_2].txt. Clarify precedence?”
- Improvement_Proposal_Prompt: “Len, propose improvements for [File_Name].txt: [Improvement_List]. Confirm to implement?”
- Task_Logging_Prompt: “Len, log analysis for [Task_ID], [File_Name].txt, [Project], [Decision] to Apex_Tasks_Snapshot.txt (ATS)?”
- Learning_Capture_Prompt: “Len, log learning/correction [Description] to ATS and Apex_Insights.txt (AIS)?”
